Follow these steps to initialize a PiKVM session:

## Step 1 — Check Resolution
Call \`pikvm_get_resolution\` to determine the screen size and confirm the connection is working.

## Step 2 — Load the Redaction Model
Call \`pikvm_load_model\`. Screenshots are redacted before you see them, and this loads the models that do it. It can take up to a minute. If it fails, report the error — screenshots will not be available.

## Step 3 — Take Initial Screenshot
Call \`pikvm_redacted_screenshot\` to see the current state of the remote machine. This confirms video capture and redaction are working and shows you what's on screen. Black boxes mark redacted sensitive content.

## Step 4 — Calibrate Mouse
Run auto-calibration to ensure accurate mouse positioning.

1. Call \`pikvm_auto_calibrate\` — it automatically detects the cursor and computes calibration factors.
2. If it succeeds, calibration is applied automatically. Proceed to Step 5.
3. If it fails, fall back to manual calibration:
   1. Call \`pikvm_calibrate\` — this moves the cursor to the screen center.
   2. Call \`pikvm_redacted_screenshot\` — visually locate the actual cursor position.
   3. If the cursor is **not** at the center, calculate correction factors:
      - factorX = expected_x / actual_x
      - factorY = expected_y / actual_y
   4. Call \`pikvm_set_calibration\` with the calculated factors.
   5. Call \`pikvm_redacted_screenshot\` again to verify the calibration looks correct.

## Step 5 — Verify Keyboard (optional)
If you will be typing:
1. Identify a safe text input area on screen (e.g., a terminal, text editor, address bar).
2. Click on it with \`pikvm_mouse_click\`.
3. Type a short test string with \`pikvm_type\`.
4. Take a screenshot to verify the text appeared correctly.

## Step 6 — Report Ready
Summarize:
- Screen resolution
- What OS/application is visible
- Redaction model status
- Calibration status
- Any issues detected

The session is now ready for use. When the session is finished, call \`pikvm_release_model\` to free the redaction model's memory.`,

Mouse calibration corrects the offset between where you tell the cursor to go and where it actually lands. Run this whenever you start a session or after a resolution change.

## Preferred: Auto-Calibration
Call \`pikvm_auto_calibrate\`. This automatically detects the cursor via screenshot diffing and computes calibration factors. If it succeeds, calibration is applied immediately — no further steps needed.

If auto-calibration fails (e.g., cursor is hidden, heavy screen animations), use the manual procedure below.

## Manual Calibration (Fallback)

### Step 1 — Get Resolution
Call \`pikvm_get_resolution\` and note the width and height. The expected center is (width/2, height/2).

### Step 2 — Start Calibration
Call \`pikvm_calibrate\`. The server moves the cursor to what it believes is the screen center and returns the expected position.

### Step 3 — Screenshot and Locate Cursor
Call \`pikvm_redacted_screenshot\`. Find the actual cursor position in the image. The cursor is typically an arrow or crosshair.

### Step 4 — Calculate Factors
Compute:
- **factorX** = expected_x / actual_x
- **factorY** = expected_y / actual_y

Example: If expected is (960, 540) but the cursor landed at (720, 405):
- factorX = 960 / 720 = 1.3333
- factorY = 540 / 405 = 1.3333

If the cursor is exactly at center, factors are 1.0 (no correction needed).

### Step 5 — Apply Calibration
Call \`pikvm_set_calibration\` with the computed factorX and factorY.

### Step 6 — Verify
Move the mouse to a known corner or UI element using \`pikvm_mouse_move\`, then take a screenshot to confirm the cursor landed where expected. If it's still off, repeat from Step 2.

## Notes
- Calibration is automatically cleared when screen resolution changes.
- Factors are typically between 1.0 and 1.5. Values outside this range may indicate a measurement error.
- You can check current calibration at any time with \`pikvm_get_calibration\`.`,

            text: `# Auto-Calibrate Mouse Workflow

Automatic calibration detects the cursor by diffing screenshots and computes calibration factors without any manual coordinate estimation.

## Step 1 — Run Auto-Calibration
Call \`pikvm_auto_calibrate\`. The tool will:
1. Move the mouse to various positions across the screen
2. Take pairs of screenshots and diff them to detect cursor movement
3. Compute calibration factors from detected vs expected positions
4. Verify accuracy by checking the cursor lands within 20px of targets

This takes ~30-60 seconds depending on the number of rounds and connection speed.

## Step 2 — Check Result
The tool returns success/failure, calibration factors, and a confidence score.

- **Success**: Calibration is applied automatically. You can proceed to use mouse tools.
- **Failure**: The tool will suggest next steps. Common fixes:
  - Increase \`moveDelayMs\` (e.g., 500 or 800) for slow PiKVM connections
  - Ensure the cursor is visible (not hidden by the OS)
  - Ensure the desktop is static (close videos, stop animations)
  - Fall back to manual calibration with the \`calibrate-mouse-workflow\`

## Step 3 — Verify (Optional)
Move the mouse to a known UI element with \`pikvm_mouse_click\` and take a screenshot to confirm the click landed correctly.

## Tips
- Auto-calibration is the **preferred** method. Only use manual calibration as a fallback.
- Other PiKVM tools are blocked while calibration is running.
- If the remote screen resolution changes, you'll need to recalibrate.
- Calibration factors are typically between 1.0 and 1.5. A factor of 1.0 means no correction is needed on that axis.`,

Target: **${element}**

## Step 1 — Observe
Take a screenshot with \`pikvm_redacted_screenshot\` to see the current screen state.

## Step 2 — Analyze
Examine the screenshot and locate **${element}**. Identify its approximate center coordinates in pixels.

If the element is **not visible**:
- It may be off-screen — try scrolling with \`pikvm_mouse_scroll\`.
- It may be behind another window — try Alt+Tab or click elsewhere first.
- It may require a menu or dialog to be opened first.

## Step 3 — Click
Call \`pikvm_mouse_click\` with the x and y coordinates of the element center.
\`\`\`json
{ "name": "pikvm_mouse_click", "arguments": { "x": <x>, "y": <y> } }
\`\`\`

## Step 4 — Verify
Take another screenshot to confirm:
- The element was clicked (e.g., a menu opened, a button was pressed, a field is focused).
- The expected result occurred.

If the click missed, adjust coordinates and retry. If calibration seems off, run the calibrate-mouse-workflow first.`,

Target: **${form}**

## Step 1 — Screenshot and Identify Fields
Call \`pikvm_redacted_screenshot\` and identify all input fields, their labels, current values, and positions.

## Step 2 — For Each Field
Repeat for every field that needs to be filled:

1. **Click the field** — Use \`pikvm_mouse_click\` at the field's center coordinates to focus it.
2. **Clear existing content** (if any) — Use \`pikvm_shortcut\` with \`["ControlLeft", "KeyA"]\` to select all, then \`pikvm_key\` with \`Delete\` or \`Backspace\`.
3. **Type the value** — Use \`pikvm_type\` with the desired text.
4. **Move to next field** — Use \`pikvm_key\` with \`Tab\` to advance, or click the next field directly.

## Step 3 — Verify
Take a screenshot to check all fields are filled correctly.

## Step 4 — Submit (if appropriate)
- Click the Submit/OK/Save button using \`pikvm_mouse_click\`, or
- Press Enter with \`pikvm_key\` if the form supports it.

## Step 5 — Confirm
Take a final screenshot to verify the form was accepted (look for success messages, page changes, or error indicators).

## Tips
- For dropdown/select fields: click to open, then click the desired option (take a screenshot after opening to see choices).
- For checkboxes/radio buttons: a single click toggles them.
- For date pickers: try typing the date directly into the field before attempting to use the picker widget.
- If a field requires special characters, \`pikvm_type\` handles them via keymap conversion.`,

Goal: **${goal}**

Use an **Observe-Plan-Act-Verify** loop until the goal is achieved.

## The Loop

### Observe
Take a screenshot with \`pikvm_redacted_screenshot\`. Identify:
- What OS / desktop environment is running (Windows, macOS, Linux/GNOME, Linux/KDE, etc.)
- What applications/windows are currently open
- Where relevant UI elements are (taskbar, dock, menus, desktop icons)

### Plan
Decide the next action to get closer to the goal. Common desktop patterns:

**Opening applications:**
- Taskbar/dock: click the application icon
- Start menu / application launcher: click the menu button, then search or browse
- Terminal: open a terminal and run the application command
- Desktop shortcut: double-click the icon

**Common shortcuts:**
- Open file manager: often on taskbar or via Super key
- Open terminal: Ctrl+Alt+T (many Linux DEs), or right-click desktop
- Search: Super key (Windows/GNOME), Cmd+Space (macOS)
- Switch windows: Alt+Tab
- Show desktop: Super+D (Windows/some Linux)
- Close window: Alt+F4

### Act
Execute the planned action using the appropriate PiKVM tool:
- \`pikvm_mouse_click\` for clicking UI elements
- \`pikvm_key\` or \`pikvm_shortcut\` for keyboard shortcuts
- \`pikvm_type\` for typing in search bars or terminals
- \`pikvm_mouse_scroll\` for scrolling through menus or file lists

### Verify
Take another screenshot to confirm the action had the expected effect. If not, reassess and try an alternative approach.

## Repeat
Continue the Observe-Plan-Act-Verify loop until the goal **${goal}** is achieved. If \`pikvm_redacted_screenshot\` reports that the redaction model is not loaded, call \`pikvm_load_model\` and retry. If you get stuck, try a different approach (e.g., use keyboard shortcuts instead of mouse, or use a terminal command instead of the GUI).`,
