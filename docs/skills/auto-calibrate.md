# auto-calibrate

> MCP Prompt: `auto-calibrate`

Guide for automatic mouse calibration with pikvm_auto_calibrate.

## Arguments

None.

## How It Works

`pikvm_auto_calibrate` detects the cursor by moving it a known distance and diffing pairs of screenshots:

1. Moves the mouse to a random position, takes screenshot A
2. Moves a known delta (80-150px), takes screenshot B
3. Diffs A and B to find cursor-sized pixel clusters
4. Compares detected movement vector to commanded delta
5. Repeats across multiple rounds to collect samples
6. Computes calibration factors from median of detected/expected ratios
7. Verifies by moving to random targets and checking accuracy

The screenshots used for diffing are raw (unredacted) captures, but they are only processed inside the server and are never returned to the client.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| rounds | number | 5 | Sampling rounds |
| verifyRounds | number | 5 | Verification rounds |
| moveDelayMs | number | 300 | Delay after each mouse move (ms) |

## Example

```json
{ "name": "pikvm_auto_calibrate" }
```

With custom delay for slow connections:

```json
{ "name": "pikvm_auto_calibrate", "arguments": { "moveDelayMs": 500 } }
```

## Tips

- Preferred over manual calibration — try this first.
- Other tools are blocked during calibration.
- Increase `moveDelayMs` if calibration fails on slow connections.
- Works best on a static desktop without animations or videos near the cursor.
- Falls back gracefully with a suggestion to use manual calibration if detection fails.
